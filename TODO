create true false value for ghost method on image controller
link image controller to ghost controller
OR
add soft delete column to db and get rid of the fucking ghost controller, since it's dumb

create importable import files to quickly grab application components
   maybe an import class
   look into load path



create config yaml and config importer

a migration manager would be cool, and we never seem to be done with migrations

maybe make a master class for all these tools you apparently need to build?

at some point I should just be using rails, right
