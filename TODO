link image controller to ghost controller

create importable import files to quickly grab application components
   maybe an import class
   look into load path


create config yaml and config importer

a migration manager would be cool, and we never seem to be done with migrations

maybe make a master class for all these tools you apparently need to build?

at some point I should just be using rails, right
